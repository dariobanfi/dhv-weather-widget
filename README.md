# DHV Weather Widget

An Android home screen widget that fetches and displays paragliding weather forecasts from [dhv.de](https://www.dhv.de/wetter/dhv-wetter/). 

The UI is **Material 3 inspired**, fully integrating with **Material You** principles. It features:
- **Dynamic Colors:** Adapts its color palette to the user's wallpaper and system theme.
- **Modern Typography:** Optimized for Google Sans on Pixel devices.
- **Adaptive Sizing:** A fluid, compact layout that expands to show more detail when resized.
- **Semantic Status Styling:** Color-coded weather status cards using M3 tonal palettes.

> **Note:** This project is implemented entirely via **Gemini CLI**, demonstrating autonomous software engineering through LLM-driven development.
